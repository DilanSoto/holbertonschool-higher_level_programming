# Python - Object-relational mapping

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without relying on Google:

### General
- How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
- How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
- How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
- Understanding of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
- How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Execution with MySQLdb version 2.0.x
- Execution with SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should adhere to pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- Length of files will be tested using wc
- All modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- Documentation should be a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method

Note: Execution of SQL queries using SQLAlchemy's execute is not permitted.
